You can use [Jeka][1] along its nodeJs plugin as library.
Import these 2 libs:
 - dev.jeka:jeka-core:0.11.11
 - dev.jeka:nodejs-plugin:0.11.11

Then just execute:

    JkNodeJs.ofVersion("22.12.0")
        .npx("cowsay Hello World !");

This will download Node.js v22.12.0 on the first run and execute the npx command. Subsequent runs will be faster, as the downloaded Node.js version will be cached.
