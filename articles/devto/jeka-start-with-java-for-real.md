[JeKa](https://jeka.dev) is a modern Java build tool focused on simplicity.

When starting with Java, developers usually just write some code, compile it, and run it. However, this is not enough to create useful Java applications or libraries that others can reuse. To build something practical in Java, we need to:
- Use third-party libraries (e.g., Guava, Gson, Commons CLI, etc.)
- Package and deploy the application/library so others can use it.

This is often done with traditional build tools like *Maven* or *Gradle*. These tools require significant learning and can involve tedious configuration.
A simpler alternative is [JBang](https://jbang.dev), which lets you write single-file Java scripts and easily share them.

On the other hand, [Jeka](https://jek.dev) offers simple dependency management and deployment ala *JBang* while allowing you to build standard multi-class applications or libraries with proper tests included.

### Scaffold a New Code Base

**Prerequisite:** Jeka must be [installed](../installation.md).

**Tip:** To list available options, execute: `jeka base: --doc`.

To create a base structure, ready for starting coding right away, execute:
```
jeka base: scaffold scaffold.kind=APP
```

You’ll get the following project structure:
```
. 
├── jeka-src             <- Source root directory
│   ├── _dev             <- Optional package containing all non-prod (build and test)
│   │   ├── test
│   │   └── Build.java  
│   └── app              <- Sugested base package for production code/resources
│       └── App.java     
├── jeka-output          <- Generated dir where artifacts as jars, classes, reports or doc are generated
├── jeka.properties      <- Build configuration  (Java and jeka version, kben configurations, ...)
└── README.md            <- Describes available build commands
```

All your Java code is supposed to be in the *jeka-src* folder.

`_dev` is a special package for source code and dependencies used only for development (e.g., tests, builds).If you're new to Java, you can ignore or delete it.

The scaffolded example includes an *App* class in the *app* package. You can add or modify classes in any package you like.

## Sync with IntelliJ

To sync with IntelliJ, execute:
```
jeka intellij: iml --force
```
If changes don't appear in IntelliJ, go to the project's root directory, and run: `jeka intellij: initProject`.

## Add Dependencies

The *App.java* class declares a `@JkDep` annotation to reference a library. You can add as many libraries as needed. A good practice is to declare all libraries in the same base class.

```java
@JkDep("com.github.lalyos:jfiglet:0.8.9")
@JkDep("com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom::pom:2.18.2")
@JkDep("com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core")
@JkDep("com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations")
public class App {
    ...
}
```

See [details on dependency notations](../reference/api-dependency-management.md#string-notation).

Additionally, you can copy-paste JAR files into the following directory to automatically include them as dependencies:
```
├── jeka-boot      <- Jars included in the production classpath.
```

**Declare non-prod dependencies**

Declare dependency on any class under `_dev` package, to add dependency with embedding them in production.

```java
package _dev;

@JkDep("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.11.4")
@JkDep("org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter:5.15.2")
class Build extends KBean {
    ...
}
```
**Reminder:** Don't forget to run `jeka intellij: iml` once you have modified the dependencies.

## Run your Application

The application can be run using:
```shell
jeka --program arg0 args1 ... # or `jeka -p` for short
```
To clean compilation before starting, use `--clean` option (`-c` for short).

If ths source code is hosted in a Git repo, the application can be directly executed by referencing the repo as:
```shell
jeka --remote [git repo url] --program arg0 arg1 ... # or jeka -r [git repo url] -p
```
## Create a Library

If you want to write a library, instead of an application, you need to declare both *moduleId* and versioning in order to publish it on a *Maven* repository:

```property
@base.moduleId=org.example:my-lib
@base.version=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Now, you can publish your library by executing:
```shell
jeka maven: publish
```

## Pre-defined Build Commands

```
jeka base: test       # Runs tests
jeka base: pack       # Runs tests + creates jars
jeka base: runJar     # Runs the jar generated by the above command
jeka base: info       # Displays project configuration info
jeka base: depTree    # Displays dependency trees 
```
Other commands:
``` 
jeka native: compile     # Compiles to native executable

jeka docker: build       # Builds a Docker image for the project
jeka docker: info        # Displays info about generated image.
jeka docker: buildNative # Builds a Docker image containing the native executable
jeka docker: infoNative  # Displays info about generated native image 

jeka maven: publishLocal # Publish artifacts in the local repository
jeka maven: publish      # Publish in the defined Maven repository
```
