🌟 JeKa: Ditch your Old Java Build Tools

While Java is trending toward becoming a simpler and lighter language to attract more developers,
the complexity of its build tools—based on XML or external scripting languages—remains a real pain in the neck.

That's where JeKa comes in. It's a project I started a few years ago and recently launched, offering:

🤝  A focus on user-friendliness without compromising power

🪽  Lightness and super-portability (works where there's no Java)

☕  Configuration with simple properties or Java code

🚀  Direct execution of Java source code

These characteristics make JeKa extraordinarily simple to use, both for beginners and when handling complex scenarios,
making Java just more fun to work with.

Since JeKa already supports common technologies like Spring Boot, Docker, Native images, OpenAPI, SonarQube, and more,
you can likely give it a real try.
