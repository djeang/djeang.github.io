# Plan

Title: Why we need to change Jave build tool ?

1. Simplify for newcommers : mvn gradle XML Kotlin... -> expect zero configuration
   ... but handling complexity gracefully too (transition for next point)
2. Properties for basic conf, Java for the specific conf and script -> run ddebug navigate in IDE run in command line
2. Easy to extend (write plugin)
3. Easy to share build logic (template)
4. DEVOPS


Nice to have
4. Portability -> (java version evolve fast) JDK for juggling with java version lightness?
5. Run Java as code





# 5 Reasons Java Needs a Pure Java Build Tool

In recent discussions about simplifying Java development, one point keeps coming up: the build tools are a barrier. 
While the language itself has become more streamlined, the tools we use to build and manage Java projects still feel complicated.
The usual suspects, like Maven and Gradle, are powerful but require extensive XML configuration or external DSLs like Kotlin or Groovy
And here’s the thing: if Java’s going to be more accessible, the build tools need to evolve too.

I believe it’s time for Java to have a pure Java build tool that is easy to use, fast to set up, 
and still capable of handling complex tasks. Here’s why.

## 1. Simplifying for New Developers

The number one reason we need a simpler Java build tool is for newcomers. New developers want to write code, not spend hours configuring their build systems. When you’re just getting started with Java, the last thing you want is to wrestle with complex configurations. What developers need is a tool that lets them code, manage dependencies, build JAR files, and run applications with minimal setup.

And once they get past the basics, the tool shouldn’t suddenly require a steep learning curve. It should grow with them, handling larger, real-world projects without losing that beginner-friendly simplicity. If the tool they start with can handle both simple and complex tasks, they’ll spend less time on setup and more time coding.

## 2. Quick and Easy Setup

Another point I’ve seen repeatedly is that Java build tools should be lightweight and quick to set up. The less time spent on configuration, the more time developers can focus on actual development. No one wants to waste an hour just to get their build system running.

A pure Java build tool should be fast, easy to install, and require minimal configuration. Developers should be able to start a project without worrying about managing multiple dependencies or setting up a complicated environment. Simple, efficient, and direct—that’s what we need.

## 3. Consistency with Java

Most current Java build tools rely on additional languages like Groovy or Bash to handle tasks like automation or deployment. This adds unnecessary complexity and makes debugging more difficult. I’ve heard this concern from many developers: it’s hard to maintain consistency when your build system isn’t using the same language as your code.

A pure Java build tool would solve that problem. Everything—dependencies, automation, builds—could be handled directly in Java. You wouldn’t need to jump between languages or learn a bunch of extra tools. By sticking to one language, it becomes much easier to debug, share, and maintain code, making the development process smoother overall.

## 4. Portability Made Simple

One of the biggest frustrations with traditional build tools is that they often require specific JDK versions or third-party software on the machine. When you move between environments, things break. And if you're working in a team, getting everyone to use the same configuration can be a nightmare.

A pure Java build tool would solve this by automatically managing JDK versions and dependencies for you. Developers wouldn’t need to worry about setup or compatibility issues. The tool would handle it all, ensuring that builds are consistent and reliable across environments.

## 5. Keeping It Simple, Yet Powerful

Java as a language has gotten simpler, and it’s time the build tools followed suit. Lightweight tools like **JeKa** and **Jbang** are already showing that it’s possible to have a tool that’s both fast and powerful. These tools streamline the build process, allowing developers to focus on building software, not managing the environment.

A pure Java build tool would combine the best of both worlds: it would be simple enough for small projects, yet powerful enough to handle the complexity of larger systems. Developers could start quickly, scale as needed, and keep everything within the Java ecosystem.

## Conclusion

As Java continues to evolve, so should its build tools. A pure Java build tool that’s easy to set up, consistent, and portable would make Java development more accessible and efficient for everyone. Tools like JeKa and Jbang are already paving the way, but the future of Java development depends on adopting a build system that is as simple and powerful as the language itself. It’s time to move forward—without the complexity.
